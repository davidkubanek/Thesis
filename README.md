# MSc Thesis on Geometric Deep Learning
Predicting bioactivity of small molecules.

- HTS_fingerprints.ipynb generates HTS fingerprints for molecules collected from PubChem bioassays as in (Helal et al., 2016).
- concerto.ipynb replicates the CONCERTO architecture applied to the HTSFP data generated in HTS_fingerprints.ipynb.
- Data files required to run the scripts above are not published on GitHub at this time due to size constraints
